# Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, a
# nd they can con
# tain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner.
#
# my_list = []
# my_list.append("hello")
# my_list.append("to")
# my_list.append("you")
# my_list.append("too")
# for i in my_list:
#     all = i
#
# print([1,2,3])
